Mental Moshpit is an evolving project designed to document and showcase my growth as a game developer.
Each scene and level represents a milestone in my journey, reflecting both technical learning and creative experimentation.

The project begins with Mini Game, a foundational scene built using basic shapes, simple physics, and AI tracking systems. As I continue developing Mental Moshpit, I will enhance these early builds by introducing custom assets, new functionalities, original music, a full title screen, a level selection system, and more.

The long-term vision is to create a World Selector experience where players can progress through each stage of development, experiencing the continuous evolution of the project — from its simplest beginnings to a fully realized creative work.

Mental Moshpit is not just a project — it's a living record of passion, persistence, and growth in game development.
